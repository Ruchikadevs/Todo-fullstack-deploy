# How to Run Locally

## 1. Start Backend

Navigate to the **Backend** folder.

Run:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend server runs on:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You can verify the API by visiting:

```
http://localhost:8080/todos
```

---

## 2. Start Frontend

Navigate to the **Frontend** folder.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 3. Open the Application

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

The React frontend will communicate with the Spring Boot backend running on **port 8080**.
